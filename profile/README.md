Welcome to **HKOpenAI**, a pioneering open-source project dedicated to enhancing AI capabilities by providing access to a wide range of data specific to Hong Kong. Our mission is to foster innovation and collaboration through the development of multiple **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers hosted on GitHub. 🚀

## About HKOpenAI 📖

HKOpenAI is an initiative to create and maintain a collection of MCP servers that offer structured access to various datasets and tools relevant to Hong Kong. These servers enable AI models and developers to interact with real-time and historical data, facilitating the creation of intelligent, context-aware applications tailored to the unique needs of Hong Kong's community. 🌆

## Our MCP Servers 🛠️

We host a growing number of MCP servers, each focusing on different aspects of data and functionality for Hong Kong. Some of our key projects include:
